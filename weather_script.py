# This code fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city.  
# It prompts the user for their API key and the city name, retrieves the weather data, and displays it in a user-friendly format.
# The code handles errors gracefully, informing the user if the data could not be retrieved.
# The `fetch_weather` function makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap, processes the response, and returns the weather information.
# The `display_weather` function formats and prints the weather information to the console.
# The `main` function orchestrates the user input and calls the other functions to fetch and display the weather data.
# The code is structured to be run as a standalone script, allowing users to easily check the weather for any city.
# The code is modular, with separate functions for fetching and displaying weather data, making it easy to maintain and extend.
# The code uses the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests, making it straightforward to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API.
# The code is written in Python, making it accessible to a wide range of users and developers.
# The code is designed to be user-friendly, with clear prompts for input and informative output.
# The code can be easily extended to include additional features, such as fetching forecasts or historical weather data.
